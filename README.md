# Anonymous Identity-Based User Management System

**Definition:**
The Anonymous Identity-Based User Management System is a framework that allows users to interact with a platform without the need for complex account creation processes. Each user is assigned a unique identifier (UUID), which is stored in browser cookies. This enables the platform to recognize users upon subsequent visits without requiring explicit account logins.

2. **Cookie-Based Storage:** Identifiers are stored in browser cookies, ensuring users are recognized on subsequent visits.
3. **Automatic Account Creation:** New users are automatically assigned a unique identifier, while returning users continue with their existing identifier.
4. **Simple Username Management:** Users are given a default username linked to their identifier, which can be changed as desired.
5. **Anonymous Access:** Users can access the platform anonymously without the need for account creation.

**Advantages:**
- Simplifies user experience.
